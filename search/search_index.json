We define, modify, use these variables and objects to make our programs run. Programs use key words to define characteristics of variables or objects. Basic keywords: public - an object accessible by other classes (files) private - an object only accessible by its containing class (file). protected - like private but can be seen by subclasses return - value to return or give back after method execution (run). void - a method that returns no value IMPORTANT NOTE Java is case sensitive, meaning capitalization matters! Classes # Classes are the files that contain our programming A program can be made up of one class but can also be made up of many classes All programs run a main class that can optionally load additional classes either directly or indirectly Example main loads class1, class1 loads class2 Classes are made up of variables and methods and are often used to separate and organize your code. Classes can also call (use) variables or methods of other classes if those have been set to public. Constructors # Classes can also have a constructor which is a special type of method that has the same name (case sensitive) as the class file Constructors are always called when the class is loaded into the program for the first time. This is often the only time they are called. Constructors are called when trying to access the class in other files. They can be called again if the class is programmed to be unloaded (destroyed) and reloaded. Calls to methods, and assignment of values, within the constructor will run as soon as the class is called (loaded) in the code. Methods # Methods, also known as functions, can be thought of as subprograms or routines that run inside of your main program. Methods are used when you want to run the same code multiple times. Copying and pasting code is BAD! Use methods instead! Methods are also useful to access only certain parts or functions of another class. Methods can also have their own variables ( local ) or use variables available throughout the whole class ( global variables ), this will be explained more in the scope section . Methods can call (use) other methods, even multiple times. Example int value ; void increment (){ value ++; } Parameters # Parameters are variables that are passed (sent) to a method for it to use. You can pass more than one parameter but order matters when calling the method. Example // Example of a method with a parameter double half ( int num1 ){ double multiplier = 0.5 ; return num1 * multiplier ; } int newNumber = half ( 12 ); // <---- Method being called (used) in code Variables # Variables are objects that contain data, they are characterized by data types Variables are assigned names and data types on creation Names can be anything with the exception of pre-existing keywords such as public or int Data types define what type of data is being stored in the variables: int - integers (whole numbers) double - double precision floating point (fractional/decimal values) boolean - true or false (true = 1 or false = 0) values. string - text values contained in parentheses Example: int sum; A variable that can hold whole number values Example: boolean isFull = true; A variable can either hold a true or false value and is being assigned a true value Most non-static variables can have their values assigned or assigned at any point elsewhere in your program Scope # When creating a variable, where you create it matters. This is known as the scope of a variable. The scope is where a variable can be seen within a class A variable created in a method can only be seen in that method. This is a local variable. A variable created outside a method can be seen in all methods of that class (file). This is a global variable. It is good practice to put them all at the top before your first method. Example of a Local Variable public int testMethod () { int example = 12 ; // Instide of method example = example + 1 ; return example } Example of a Public Variable int example = 12 ; // Outside of method public void testMethod () { example = example + 1 ; return example } Comments # Comments are a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a program. Comments do not affect what the code does. Comments are often used to leave notes or explanations of what methods or classes are doing so that it is easier to understand the code. Example: Single Line Comments // This is what a single line comment looks like // You can also have multiple // single line comments in a row Example: Multi Line Comments /* This is what a multiline comment looks like */ Example: Doc Comments /** * This is a doc comment * * <ul> * <li>They can be viewed by hovering over code they are attached to</li> * <li>They can be formatted with HTML</li> * </ul> */ Conventions # There are also many different conventions when programming, this ensures that programs are readable between different people.

There are classes to handle sensors, motor speed controllers, the driver station, and a number of other utility functions. Documentation is available at http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java WPILib adds those sensors and controllers as additional data types (like int or double ) and classes. Examples Talon , Solenoid , Encoder ... Command Based Robot # For our programming tutorial we will be creating a Command based robot Command Based Robots are much like Legos, with very basic pieces you can make something simple like a house or complicated like a replica Star Wars Millennium Falcon A command based robot is broken down into subsystem classes and command classes. In the code, a command based robot is made up of 3 packages ( folders ) labeled robot, commands, and subsystems There are other types of robots but we will use Command Based Subsystems # A subsystem is a special template class made by FRC. In robotics, subsystems are sections of the whole robot. For example every FRC robot has a Drivetrain subsystem which is what controls the robot\u2019s driving both physically and programmatically. To avoid confusion between software and mechanical teams, subsystems should be called the same thing. If we have a ball intake system, we will both call it Intake or Collector . Subsystems of a robot can contain parts to control or read data from. The Drivetrain subsystem could contain motor controllers and encoders both physically and programmatically. Using a dog as an example: the legs , tail , and head are subsystems . The head subsystem has the parts: eyes , ears , and nose . When programming subsystems we use variables and methods to tell our subsystem what it has and what it is capable of or should do. These variables will be the parts in the subsystem These methods will define what those parts are capable of. Using a dog head subsystem as an example: Some variables (parts) would be: leftEye , rightEye , nose , leftEar , rightEar . Some example methods would be closeEyes or openEyes since these are things the dog are capable of. These methods would use both the leftEye and rightEye and close them. Example //This method closes the dog eyes public void closeEyes (){ leftEye . close (); rightEye . close (); A robot example of a Drivetrain subsystem would have leftMotor , and rightMotor as variables and setSpeed as a method telling it how to set the speed of those motor controllers. Having the setSpeed method tells our program that our Drivetrain subsystem can set its speed. Example //This method sets the speed of the drivetrain public void setSpeed ( double speed ){ leftMotor . set ( speed ); rightMotor . set ( speed ); } Commands # A command is a special template class (file) made by FRC. In robotics, commands are actions you want a robot to do (just like a real life command). A command is an action a subsystem(s) performs. For example you may want your robot to drive full speed forward so you make a command class called DriveForward . Since a robot uses a Drivetrain subsystem to control its motors, this command would call our previously created setSpeed method from that subsystem. Tip Subsystems define what the robot is made of and what it can do while commands actually tell the robot to do those things Using a dog as an example we can tell the dog to blink by creating a BlinkEyes command The command would call the method, closeEyes() then the method openEyes() BlinkEyes Command //This command will continuously run the two methods in execute protected void execute () { dog . head . closeEyes (); dog . head . openEyes (); } A robot example of a DriveForward command would call (use) the setSpeed methods that we created in the Drivetrain subsystem DriveForward , when executed, will tell our robot to drive forward using the Drivetrain subsystem DriveForward Command //This command tells the robot to drive forward full speed protected void initialize (){ robot . drivetrain . setSpeed ( 1.0 ); } Default Command Structure # The template for FRC commands actually come with some pre-defined methods that have special properties for FRC robots, they are: initialize() - Methods in here are called just before this Command runs the first time. execute() - Methods in here are called repeatedly when this Command is scheduled to run isFinished() - When this returns true, the Command stops running execute() end() - Methods in here are called once after isFinished returns true interrupted() - Methods in here are called when another command which requires one or more of the same subsystems is scheduled to run Tip It is good practice to call end() in interrupted() Overview of execution # In FRC programming our main class is Robot.java and all other classes (command files and subsystem files) must be loaded from Robot.java either directly or indirectly Example Robot.java loads OI.java , OI.java loads DriveForward.java . All subsystem files must be added to Robot.java \u2019s auto-created robotInit() method. This loads our subsystems into the code and allow its public methods to be useable by other files such as commands later by typing Robot.nameOfSubsystem.desiredMethod(); New Project Files # When creating a new command based robot project, the following classes (files) will be created: Robot.java - The main class of the robot which is run when a robot boots up. OI.java - This class binds our commands to a physical operator interface such as a joystick or controller. This file is already in robotInit() by default so classes called here will also be loaded by the program RobotMap.java - This class is used to hold all the ports or ID numbers of sensors or devices connected to the robot and assign them a variable name. This provides flexibility changing wiring, makes checking the wiring easier and significantly reduces the number of magic numbers floating around. ExampleSubsystem.java and ExampleCommand.java are auto-created examples.

When a robot program runs on the roboRIO it only runs the main file Robot.java and anything Robot.java links to. We have created a new subsystem but we have not yet linked it to Robot.java. We must do this for EVERY subsystem we create 1) In Robot.java we will create a new global variable of type DesiredSubsystemName (i.e. Drivetrain ) named m_desiredSubsystemName ( i.e. m_drivetrain ) and set its value to null . 2) In the robotInit() method add: m_desiredSubsystemName = new DesiredSubsystemName(); (i.e. m_drivetrain = new Drivetrain(); ) Important This must always be done above OI and Telemetry/SmartDashboard (if present). Now when we use this subsystem in commands, we must call Robot.m_desiredSubsystemName. to get access to it and its methods.
